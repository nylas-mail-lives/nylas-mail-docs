# I'm getting "Invalid Credentials" when connecting a Windows Live Domains account.

Unfortunately Nylas Mail Lives doesn't support connecting [Windows Live custom domains](https://www.domains.live.com/) accounts, since they've been deprecated by Microsoft.

However, since those accounts aren't much more than aliases to a regular Outlook.com account, you should be able to connect your original `@outlook.com` account and to set up aliases within NYlas Mail Lives.
